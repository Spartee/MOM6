# ChangeLog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0),
and this project uses `yyyy.rr[.pp]`, where `yyyy` is the year a patch is released,
`rr` is a sequential release number (starting from `01`), and an optional two-digit
sequential patch number (starting from `01`).
