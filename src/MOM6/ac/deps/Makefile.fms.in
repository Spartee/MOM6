# Makefile template for MOM6
#
# Previously this would have been generated by mkmf using a template file.
#
# The proposed autoconf build inverts this approach by constructing the
# information previously stored in the mkmf template, such as compiler names
# and flags, and importing the un-templated mkmf output for its rules and
# dependencies.
#
# While this approach does not eliminate our dependency on mkmf, it does
# promises to eliminate our reliance on platform-specific templates, and
# instead allows us to provide a configure script for determining our compilers
# and flags.  As a last resort, we provide hooks to override such settings.

# NOTE: mkmf conventions are close, but not identical, to autoconf.
